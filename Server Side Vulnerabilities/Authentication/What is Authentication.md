## What is Authentication
Authentcation is the process of verifying the identity of a user or a client
websites are potentially exposed to anyone who is connected to the internet this makes robust authentication mechanisms integral to effective web security 

There are three main types of authentication
- somthing you know: such as passwords, usernames, Emails, etc
- something you have: such as mobile phone, security token, etc
- something you are: your biometrics or pattern of behavior these are sometimes called inherence factors

authentication mechanisms rely on a range of technologies to verify one or more of these factors
